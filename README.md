**Screening Test for Project Proposal E:**
"Web page containing a Javascript widget that allows the user to populate a table
of students (name, email, level) interactively."

Name: Hikari Sakai

Description: User can add students individually or upload a .txt file to create the table. The file needs to be formatted so each new line is another student and the student's information is separated by commas: firstname, lastname, email, level. Included options to sort table based on table headers. 

Future improvements:
- Need to update sorting for levels (currently sorting levels alphabetically)
- Create a way to validate the student's information in the file input (such as checking if the level is mispelled).
- Allow other file extensions for the file input.
- Include option to search table.
- Allow user to sort table ascending or descending.
